# Concurrent-Hangman
A networked multiplayer Hangman game implemented using custom concurrency objects (instead of premade libraries). This assignment was originally part of a university course about concurrency.

Run the game by using the command from the main folder:
sbt "run zebra 3"
for the word zebra and for a maximum of 3 wrong guesses
